# GPTR: Gaussian Process Trajectory Representation for Continuous-Time Motion Estimation

## Preresiquite

* Please catkin build [SFUISE](https://github.com/ASIG-X/SFUISE) in your workspace to have the cf_msg, which is required in gptr.
* Please install Ceres 2.1.0 to run the examples and tests.
* Git clone and catkin build the repo.
  
Please raise an issue should you encounter any issue with the compilation of the package.

## Testing the lidar pipeline:

### With synthetic data

You can download and unzip the file `cloud_avia_mid_dynamic_extrinsics` from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q5fTn5OvWd_I2RvVfiUKir90q5HshzQM/view?usp=sharing). It contains the pointclouds and the prior map for the experiment.

After that, modify the path to the data and prior map in `run_sim.launch` and launch it. You should see the following visualization from rviz.

### With handheld setup

Similar to the synthetic dataset, please download the data and the prior map from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QId8X4LFxYdYewHSBXiDEAvpIFD8w-ei/view?usp=sharing).

Then specify the paths to the data and prior map in `gptr/launch/run_lio_cathhs_iot.launch` before roslaunch. You should see the following illustration.

### Evaluation

Please use the scripts `analysis_cathhs.ipynb` and `analysis_sim.ipynb` to evaluate the result.

## Testing on UWB-inertial fusion

Please download the [UTIL](https://utiasdsl.github.io/util-uwb-dataset/) (TDoA-inertial) dataset.

Change `bag_file` and `anchor_path` in `gptr/launch/run_util.launch` according to your own path.
```
roslaunch gptr run_util.launch
```
Below is an exemplary run on sequence `const2-trial4-tdoa2`

### Evaluation
Please set `if_save_traj` in `gptr/launch/run_util.launch` to `1` and change `result_save_path` accordingly. 

```
evo_ape tum /traj_save_path/gt.txt /traj_save_path/traj.txt -a --plot
```
For comparison, a baseline approach based on ESKF is available in the paper of UTIL dataset.

## Testing on visual-inertial estimation and calibration

Run the following command from terminal

```
roslaunch gptr run_vicalib.launch
```
This dataset is converted from the original one in [here](https://gitlab.com/tum-vision/lie-spline-experiments).


## Importing GPTR in your work:

The heart of our toolkit is the [GaussianProcess.hpp](gptr/include/GaussianProcess.hpp) header file which contains the abstraction of the continuous-time trajectory represented by a third-order `GaussianProcess`.

The `GaussianProcess` object provides methods to create, initialize, extend,, and query information from the trajectory.
